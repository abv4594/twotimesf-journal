# A Covered Call Strategy #

Update: 05/27/2025

## Introduction ## 

A covered call strategy with the objective to generate income. Not appreciation. The appreciation takes place in another account. 

## How ##

As the main objective is to generate income, I am selling mostly ATM calls. This extracts more extrinsic value while offering higher downside protection. I am not concerned if the stock runs. I am concerned if the stock breaks down as it would impact the principal invested. 

## How do I pick stocks ##

I select the tickers based with barchart.com premium option, filtering the best covered calls. I then filter those tickers that I am interested on (such as now Nuclear, Quantum and Bitcoin names like MSTR) and that have high vol.

## Performance so far ##

I initiated the strategy on 05/16/25. 

As of 05/27/25:

- **Theoretical gain**:   6.26% 
- **Open gain**:          1.87%

### Definitions ###

- *Theoretical gain* is how much income I generated selling calls versus the initial investment.
- *Open gain* is the gain (or loss) considering everything, including the mark to market of the stocks purchased.

The *Open gain* in this case is much lower as the result has been impacted by the recent performance of MSTR, which went from $417 to $372. However, here we see the power of the strategy to compensate for downward moves.
